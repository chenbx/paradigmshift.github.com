    <h3>Functional Pipelines? What's that?</h3>

<p>I came across this term when working through <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3688">Barski's</a> <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a> (be sure to check out his site <a href="http://www.lisperati.com">Lisperati</a> as well!) on page 309. I've googled around a bit and there seems to be no formal definition on the web, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)">Pipeline Programming</a> comes up frequently as a result of my queries, and although it seems similar i don't quite think that it's an exact explanation for what we're about to do. So for all practical purposes we'll stick with Barski's definition: <em>"A sucession of functions that operate, one after another, on a big chunk of data."</em></p>

<p>But before we get into that, we should think about what are the important concepts in functional programming and what it really means to <em>"think functionally"</em>.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>According to Paul Callaghan in his article <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-08/thinking-functionally-with-haskell">Thinking Functionally with Haskell</a>, the most important concept in functional style programming is this:</p>

<p><strong><em>It's all about data</em></strong></p>

<p>You should read the post to for a deeper look at his ideas and reasons behind them, but it boils down to this: The code should focus on what kind of data is being entered and the various transformations of the data that have to be done in order to achieve our goals.</p>

<p>This thinking is perfect for discussing and understanding the technique that Barski talks about and demonstrates in his chapter on writing a game in the functional style. We won't go into too much detail here, instead I will try to show the broad strokes and the logic that is being applied. For those who want a more specific example, go buy the book and read Chapter 15.</p>

<h3>Pipelines and Data</h3>

<p>So say that we have a 2 player game, and we have to find a way to code it in such a way that it can be expanded into a 3, 4, or even 5 player game. We might or might not want to change the rules, and we will probably want to add an AI opponent later on.</p>

<p>To make the addition of an AI player easier, and to showcase the pipeline technique, we will also create code that will output a <code>game-tree</code>, a list of all possible moves from a starting position.</p>

<p>We will need 3 basic chunks of code:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>game-tree</code> function</li>
<li>A chunk that handles the human input</li>
<li>The AI code</li>
</ul>


<p>We will feed the initial data from the <code>game-tree</code> function (a list of all possible moves) to the <code>handle-human</code> part(and AI if we're playing as one player) of our code, the <code>handle-human</code> function will then further refine the list of possible moves (based on the human player's choices) until there are no possible moves and there is a winner or a draw is declared.</p>

<h3><code>game-tree</code></h3>

<p>So let's take a look at what the <code>game-tree</code> function is composed of. Basically it will take as an input a starting board (this is randomly generated by another function, it contains starting positions), the player whose turn it is, and a list of all possible moves (these are represented as board positions) from that particular board representation. It then calls itself and passes the new board positions (the possible moves) to itself, thus creating a new list of possible board combinations based on the previous possible movements.</p>

<p><section class="code">
<code>\(\large{ \text{game-tree} \\
{\rm~~}\Rightarrow \text{player} \\
{\rm~~}\Rightarrow \text{board} \\
{\rm~~}\Rightarrow \text{possible-moves} \\
{\rm~~~~}\Rightarrow \text{game-tree} \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\Rightarrow \text{player} \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\Rightarrow \text{board} \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\ldots \ldots \ldots \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\ldots \ldots \ldots \\
}\)</code>
</section></p>

<p>Let's generate a random example to give some visual imagery to what we're talking about.</p>

<p><section class="shell">
<section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>(0 #((0 2) (1 2) (1 1) (1 1))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<pre><code> (((0 2)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
       (((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))))))))
  ((0 3)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
        ((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p>This is the result of calling the <code>game-tree</code> function.</p>

<p>The higlighted section designates the player whose turn it is, <code>0</code> is for player <code>A</code> and <code>1</code> is for player <code>B</code>; at the moment it is player <code>A</code>'s turn. The next bit is the present board: here it's saying that player <code>A</code> occupies one square of the board with 2 dice, while player <code>B</code> has 3 squares with 2, 1, and 1 die respectively.</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>(0 #((0 2) (1 2) (1 1) (1 1))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code> (((0 2)
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<pre><code>   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
       (((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>  ((0 3)
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<pre><code>   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
        ((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p>These instead are the possible moves of <code>A</code> (the first number designates the player). He can either go to the third square or the fourth square (the count starts at 0, 0 is square 1, 1 is square 2, etc.)</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>(0 #((0 2) (1 2) (1 1) (1 1))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code> (((0 2)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
       (((1 0)
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<pre><code>         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))))))))
  ((0 3)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
        ((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p>If <code>A</code> goes to square 3 then the results will be as follows, It is still player <code>A</code>'s turn, and he will occupy squares 1 and 2 with 1 die each, while <code>B</code> will have squares 2 and 4 with 2 and 1 die respectively.</p>

<p>However with the present board he has no more possible moves, hence the <code>NIL</code>, and the turn will pass to <code>B</code>, who has only one move open to him.</p>

<p>So we can see that <code>game-tree</code> will create a <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/computer-trees#module37206622">tree</a> of all possible moves given a starting position. This is the data that we will pass into our functions, which will then transform the data (in our case as you will soon see, it will merely chop off irrelevant moves) and then recursively pass it again into the said functions.</p>

<h3><code>handle-human</code></h3>

<p>Now we pass on to the function that handles the human decisions regarding which squares to attack. The code looks like this</p>

<p><section class="code">
<code>\(\large{ \text{handle-human} \leftarrow \text{tree}\\
{\rm~~}\Rightarrow \text{list of moves for player} \\
{\rm~~~~}\rightarrow \text{choose-a-move} \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\Rightarrow \text{returns the branches (or nodes) belonging to that move (let's call this new-tree)} \\
{\rm~~~~~~}\Rightarrow \text{handle-human} \leftarrow \text{new-tree}\\
}\)</code>
</section></p>

<p>So what's happening here? <code>handle-human</code> takes a tree with all the possible moves from the present position as its argument, displays the moves to the player, and waits for a choice. The player chooses a move, then <code>handle-function</code> will take the branches of the tree that belong to the move (which contain all the possible moves from that position), discard the other nodes (they are no longer relevant to the game), and call itself with the newly-revised tree as the new input.</p>

<p>Let's show a possible execution as an example. We'll use the same tree as in the previous example to make it easier:</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>(0 #((0 2) (1 2) (1 1) (1 1))
 (((0 2)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
       (((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))))))))
  ((0 3)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
        ((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p><code>handle-human</code> will display two possible moves to player <code>A</code>.</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>(0 2) -&gt; square one to three
(0 3) -&gt; square one to four
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p>Let's say <code>A</code> chooses the second choice, square one to four. <code>handle-human</code> then takes the nodes belonging to that particular choice and discard the rest.</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>(0 #((0 2) (1 2) (1 1) (1 1))
 (((0 2)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 1))
       (((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (0 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>  ((0 3)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
        ((1 0)
         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section>
</section></p>

<p>This new tree is then passed again to <code>handle-human</code> which will determine if there are possible moves from the new position. According to the tree there are none, as evidenced by the <code>NIL</code>. The turn then passes to player <code>B</code>, who has two choices: square two to three or square two to one.</p>

<p><section class="shell"></p>

<pre><code>  ((0 3)
   (0 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
    ((NIL
      (1 #((0 1) (1 2) (1 1) (0 1))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>       (((1 3)
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<pre><code>         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
</code></pre>

<p><section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>        ((1 0)

<p></section></p>

<pre><code>         (1 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (0 1)) NIL)))))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p></section></p>

<p>Player <code>B</code> takes the first choice, square two to three, and <code>handle-human</code> again picks up all the child nodes belonging to that particular branch and drops the rest.</p>

<p><section class="shell">
<section class="highlight"></p>

<pre><code>       (((1 3)
         (1 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))
          ((NIL (0 #((0 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1)) NIL)))))
</code></pre>

<p></section>
</section></p>

<p>And so on until there are no possible moves and a draw or a winner is declared.</p>

<h3>So what happened exactly?</h3>

<p>So what's so special about the way this game was coded?</p>

<p>What stands out here is that there were no changes of state with regards to the data; the initial data was not modified in any way.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>game-tree</code> takes a starting board and produces all possible moves.</li>
<li><code>handle-human</code> takes the tree and displays the moves available.</li>
<li>player makes his choice, and <code>handle-human</code> makes a new tree based on the choice made.</li>
<li>go back to step 2</li>
</ol>


<p>This is an exemplary representation of the concept <strong><em>"data first"</em></strong>. The code was based around the data given by <code>game-tree</code> and worked around transforming that data based on player decisions. Each transformation gave rise to a <strong>new</strong> tree; the old data was not touched, hence there was no assigning of variables, no book-keeping of state, of any kind.</p>

<p>This is what <strong><em>Functional Pipelines</em></strong> are all about, taking initial data and passing it around from function to function, each function taking the result of the previous function as its input. The advantage of this type of programming is that since there is no (or minimal) variable assignment, you can more or less be sure that the functions will always have the same result if they are called with the same input. This makes debugging code incredibly easy and hassle-free.</p>

<p><em>Of course some state is inevitable, but the idea here is to keep it to an absolute minimum.</em></p>

<h3>Where to Go from Here</h3>

<p>The complete source (the AI code is missing from this example) can be found in the book <a href="http://landoflisp.com">Land of Lisp</a>.</p>
